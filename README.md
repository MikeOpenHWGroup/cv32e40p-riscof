This repository is a port of the "**RISCOF** RISC-V Architectural Test Framework" to test the
[CV32E40P RISC-V Processor](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p) for compatibility to the RISC-V ISA specifications.
**Sail RISC-V** is used as reference model.
Currently, the following tests are supported:

- [x] `rv32i_m\C` - compressed instructions
- [x] `rv32i_m\I` - base integer ISA
- [x] `rv32i_m\M` - hardware multiplication and division
- [x] `rv32i_m\privilege` - privileged machine architecture
- [x] `rv32i_m\Zifencei` - instruction stream synchronization

:bulb: The general structure of this repository was setup according to the
[RISCOF installation guide](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).


## Prerequisites

This repository uses `git submodules` to bring in the CV32E40P RTL and the RISC-V Architecture tests.
You will need to clone this repo using the `--recursive` flag.

Several tools and submodules are required to run this port of the architecture test framework. The repository's
GitHub [Actions workflow](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)
takes care of installing all the required packages.

* [cv32e40p](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32) submodule - the device under test (DUT)
* [riscv-arch-test](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test) submodule - architecture test cases
* [RISC-V GCC toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain) - recommend you follow the installation specified in RISCOF Quick Start
* [Sail RISC-V](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv) - the reference model (pre-built binary in the[`bin`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof/tree/main/bin) folder)
* [RISCOF](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscof) - the architecture test framework
* [Verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator) to simulate the SystemVerilog RTL model of the CV32E40P

The framework (running all tests) is invoked via a single shell script **run.sh** that returns 0 if all tests were executed successfully or 1 if there were _any_ errors.
The exit code of this script is used to determine the overall success of the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Setup Configuration

The RISCOF **config.ini** is used to configure
the plugins to be used: the device-under-test ("DUT") and the reference model ("REF").
The ISA, debug and platform specifications, which define target-specific configurations like available ISA
extensions, ISA spec. versions and platform modules (like MTIME), are defined by `YAML` files in the according
plugin folder.

* DUT: `cv32e40p` in [`plugin-cv32e40p`](https://github.com/MikeOpenHWGroup/cv32e40p-riscof/tree/main/plugin-cv32e40p)
* REF: `sail_cSim` in [`plugin-sail_cSim`](https://github.com/MikeOpenHWGroup/cv32e40p-riscof/tree/main/plugin-sail_cSim)

Each plugin folder also provides low-level _environment_ files like linker scripts (to generate an executable
matching the target's memory layout) and platform-specific code (for example to initialize the target and
to dump the final test signatures/results).

The official [RISC-V architecture tests](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test) repository
provides test cases for all (ratified) RISC-V ISA extensions (user and privilege ISA).
Each test case checks a single instruction or core feature and is compiled into a plugin-specific executable using a RISC-V GCC toolchain.

The reference data is generated by the **Sail RISC-V Model**.
This data is compared against the results of the DUT.
<!-- TODO:
The final test report is made available as CSS-flavored HTML file via the [GitHib actions artifact](https://github.com/OpenHWGroup/cv32e40p-riscof/actions).

:bulb: It is recommended you build the toolchain and Sail model from source using the instructions provided by the RISCOF Quickstart
([here](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-riscv-gnu-toolchain) and
[here](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-plugin-models)).

## Device-Under-Test (DUT)

The [`core_tb`](https://github.com/MikeOpenHWGroup/cv32e40p-riscof/tree/main/sim) directroy provides a simple SystemVerilog testbench
and shell scripts to simulate the CV32E40P processor using **Verilator**.

The simulation scripts and the makefile for compiling and running the simulation is invoked from a DUT- specific Python script in the DUT's plugin folder
(-> [`plugin-cv32e40p/riscof_cv32e40p.py`](https://github.com/MikeOpenHWGroup/cv32e40p-riscof/blob/main/plugin-cv32e40p/riscof_cv32e40p.py)).
This Python script makes extensive use of shell commands to move and execute files and scripts.
